            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Initially, I envisioned my theme centered around Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs). My research led me to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), which houses a comprehensive database of alien sightings. I was excited about the potential of using a 3D world map to visualize the data provided by this database, along with a line graph to plot the frequency of sightings over time. I believed these visualizations would effectively convey the patterns and trends in the data, creating a compelling narrative for users.</p>

            <p>However, I soon discovered that the API used by NUFORC was not live and required a cumbersome installation process. This was a significant setback, forcing me to pivot and find a new theme for my project. After careful consideration, I settled on air pollution, recognizing it as a crucial and timely issue that impacts millions globally. Despite the change in theme, I was determined to utilize the 3D world map and line graph for this new focus.</p>

            <p>As I began my research on air pollution, I thought these visualizations would be straightforward to implement. However, I quickly realized that creating interactive and engaging data visualizations was more challenging than I had anticipated. It required a deep dive into the D3.js library and a better understanding of how to present complex data in a clear and accessible way.</p>

            <p>This unexpected journey of theme changes and technical challenges has ultimately provided me with valuable insights and a greater appreciation for the complexities of data visualization. It has also reinforced my commitment to raising awareness about air pollution and its impact on our health and environment.</p>
