            <h2>Why Air Pollution?</h2>
            <p>
                Well, it is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time, affecting the health and 
                well-being of millions globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that air pollution 
                contributes to an extreme amount of premature deaths each year, making it one of the largest 
                environmental health risks facing mankind. Through the use of this website, I want to highlight 
                and provide a deeper look at the state of air pollution across the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                By choosing this theme, I hope to inform users about real-time air quality metrics while also 
                providing historical data trends that show how air quality has changed over time.

                The 3D world map serves as an interactive globe, which I use to visualize the quality of air in different parts of the world in real time. By spinning the globe and clicking on specific countries, you can view live data, and users can easily compare pollution levels across continents. This global perspective highlights the widespread nature of air pollution while allowing for in-depth analysis in localized areas.

                The use of the line graph is more specific by offering a personalized and deeper dive into historical air quality trends. It will allow you to track air quality in specific countries, and that has changed over time.Â             </p>
